Final Project GEA Worksheet

AI Group Name: AI & Health II

Project Name: Diabetes Prediction using Neural Networks

#Goals


What are the goals of the intelligent system?

1- Develop a diabetes prediction model using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database.

2- Use various health-related factors such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels as input variables to the model.

3- Develop a model that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk for diabetes.

4- Accurately predict the presence or absence of diabetes based on the input variables.


#Environment

What is the environment that the system will be adapting within?

The environment will be the Pima Indians population, and their health indicators related to diabetes 
(features: pregnancies, glucose, bloodPressure, skinThickness, insulin, bmi, diabetesPedigreeFunction, age).

Who the stakeholders are for your system and reflect upon how your system may positively or negatively impact each of these stakeholders:

Patients: The primary stakeholder group for this system is the Pima Indian patients who will use it to predict the likelihood of developing diabetes. 
The system can positively impact patients by helping them to make lifestyle changes and take preventative measures to reduce the risk of developing diabetes. 
On the other hand, the system may negatively impact patients if it generates false positives or false negatives, leading to unnecessary anxiety or missed diagnoses.

Healthcare providers: Healthcare providers using our prediction model to make clinical decisions are potential stakeholders. 
The system can positively impact healthcare providers by providing them with informative guidance in their decision-making, producing accurate diagnosis. 
However, if the system is not accurate or reliable, it may lead to incorrect diagnoses or treatment decisions.

Researchers: Researchers who are studying diabetes and its risk factors may also be stakeholders. 
The system can positively impact researchers by providing a dataset for analysis and potentially identifying new risk factors or correlations. 
However, if the system is biased or inaccurate, it may lead to flawed research findings.

Health insurance companies: Health insurance companies are stakeholders as well, because they can now calculate risk and insurance premiums more accurately and better serve patients. 
Insurance companies may benefit from this because they can estimate risk and losses and better provide insurance services to patients more accurately.

Public: The public are the stakeholders. The model could provide more information, helping the public to better understand diabetes and its risk.
Therefore, the public's lives will be improved and they can live healthier.

#Adaptation

How might the system adapt to the environment given the goals? How might its inner environment change?

Updating weights and adjusting hyperparameters (learning rate, training iterations, etc) to improve prediction accuracy.
Utilizing cross-validation to avoid overfitting the data, improving generalized accuracy prediction.

Transfer learning: Adapt the AI system to leverage transfer learning, which can use pre-trained models from related domains to enhance the diabetes prediction model's performance, 
reduce training time, and increase generalizability across populations.
The system may adapt to changes when there is new data that is not available previously. 
Also, when there are new models and algorithms introduced, the system may adapt to these technologies as well.

Our system would be intended to help screen for diabetes.
